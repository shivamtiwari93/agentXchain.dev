## Post

Most multi-agent coding demos have the same flaw: the agents agree with each other, dump a diff, and nobody can explain why the result should ship.

AgentXchain is built around the opposite idea. Agents are required to challenge prior work before a governed run can advance. The value is not “more agents.” The value is a delivery protocol that makes disagreement, evidence, and approval explicit.

What that means in practice:

- Every turn must include at least one objection about the prior turn
- Humans approve phase transitions and the final ship decision
- Decisions, objections, evidence, and `files_changed` are recorded in append-only repo artifacts
- The same governance contract works across `manual`, `local_cli`, `api_proxy`, `mcp`, and `remote_agent`

`v2.155.73` tightens governed-run recovery and release readiness:

- Recovery events now carry structured class, severity, actor action, and operator action metadata.
- Governance reports render recovery health from event history.
- `step --resume` rejects retained live worker PIDs before reactivating governed runs.
- Ghost blocker clearing writes the matching session checkpoint.
- Configurable per-turn deadlines, restart-safe intake, and the Claude recovery hardening wave are included.
- The DOGFOOD credential smoke helper remains available as a shipped npx bin for state-free diagnostics.

- npm test -- --test-timeout=60000 -> 7386 tests / 1485 suites / 0 failures / 0 skipped
- 108 conformance fixtures across 13 protocol surfaces
