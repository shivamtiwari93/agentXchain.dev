## Thread

**Tweet 1 (hook):**

Most multi-agent AI coding demos: three agents agree with each other, dump a diff, nobody can explain why it should ship.

We built the opposite: agents are REQUIRED to challenge each other. Blind agreement is rejected by the orchestrator.

AgentXchain v2.128.0 is live. Open source. MIT.

**Tweet 2 (30-second demo):**

See it work in 30 seconds. No API keys:

```
npx --yes -p agentxchain@latest -c "agentxchain demo"
```

PM scopes auth-token rotation, raises a missing-rollback risk.
Dev implements, resolves it, raises clock-skew.
QA reviews, raises a compliance gap.

3 agents. 3 different failure classes caught. 1.8 seconds.

**Tweet 3 (how it works):**

How it works:

- PM plans -> Dev builds -> QA reviews
- Every turn MUST include an objection about the prior work
- Human approves phase transitions and the final ship decision
- Phase gates enforce real artifacts before work advances
- Every decision goes into an append-only audit trail

The orchestrator enforces the rules. It doesn't make decisions.

**Tweet 4 (real proof):**

All 5 adapter types proven live:

- manual (human-in-the-loop control path)
- local_cli (Claude Code, any CLI agent, proven with a real model)
- api_proxy (direct LLM API with proposal staging, proven with a real model)
- MCP (stdio + streamable HTTP with Anthropic API)
- remote_agent (HTTP bridge, proven live and with real-model output)

`local_cli`, `api_proxy`, `mcp`, and `remote_agent` have real-model proof. `manual` is the governed human control path.

New in this release:

- governed `run` now enforces the existing turn-timeout contract during real adapter dispatch instead of hanging indefinitely on a stuck automated turn
- `status`, `turn show`, and dashboard timeout views now show remaining budget and deadline, not just elapsed time

- 5,597 tests / 1,171 suites / 0 failures. 108 conformance fixtures. Website build clean.

**Tweet 5 (the insight):**

The insight from institutional design:

The quality of collective output depends on the STRUCTURE of disagreement, not the intelligence of participants.

Same reason code review exists for human teams.
Same reason adversarial legal systems outperform inquisitorial ones.

**Tweet 6 (positioning):**

AgentXchain is NOT:
- An agent framework (CrewAI, LangGraph, AutoGen)
- A coding assistant (Devin, Cursor, Copilot)
- A message router (A2A)
- A tool connector (MCP)

It's the governance layer BETWEEN agents. They can be built with anything. We govern how they converge.

**Tweet 7 (CTA):**

Try it:
```
npx --yes -p agentxchain@latest -c "agentxchain demo"
```

Then scaffold your own:
```
npx --yes -p agentxchain@latest -c "agentxchain init --governed"
```

GitHub: github.com/shivamtiwari93/agentXchain.dev
Docs: agentxchain.dev/docs/quickstart
npm: npmjs.com/package/agentxchain

If npm resolves a stale global install first, run:
`npx --yes -p agentxchain@latest -c "agentxchain demo"`

## Posting Notes

- Post during US working hours (10-11am ET, Tue-Thu)
- Space tweets 2-3 minutes apart
- Pin the thread to profile
- Quote-tweet Tweet 1 with any interesting reply threads
- Lead with the demo — `npx --yes -p agentxchain@latest -c "agentxchain demo"` is the strongest hook
